# Terminal About Me!

This is a simple React program just to practice with it again (also deploying which was definately my biggest struggle with this). I also learned lots about the Linux terminal and simple commands (i only included a few though).

## Note

I created the base template of this application using Vite and i just bashed it into the terminal! This made the process super easy and i'll definately continue using it !!
